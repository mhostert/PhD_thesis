This packages defines simple, yet flexible macros for typesetting equations via:
*Automatic bracing
*Vector notation
*Derivatives
*Dirac bra-ket notation
*Matrix macros
*Additional trig functions and other convenient operators
*Flat fractions and other useful miscellaneous math macros

The goal of this package is to make typesetting equations for physics simpler, 
faster, and more human-readable. To that end, the commands included in this package 
have names that make the purpose of each command immediately obvious and remove any 
ambiguity while reading and editing code for physics equations.
