In this appendix we show explicitly the factorization of $N$-final state phase space factors into $N-2$ 2-body ones. To study arbitrary observales that depend on the final state momenta, one must also be able to write down the four momenta in terms of the phase space variables. We carry out this exercise for 3 and 4 body phase space below.

\section{Factorization into 2PS}

The final decomposition of the phase space factors then reads:
\begin{align}
 \dd PS^2 = \dd m^2 \dd PS^2 (p_1, p_23) PS^2 (p_2,p_3).
\end{align}
