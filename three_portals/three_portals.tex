\caption{Schematic representation of our dark neutrino model. The dark neutrino, $\nu_{D}$ and the complex scalar $\Phi$ are the only fields charged under the new U$(1)^\prime$ gauge symmetry. The new vector boson $X_\mu$ acquires a mass after spontaneous symmetry breakig, and $N$ remains a complete singlet.
