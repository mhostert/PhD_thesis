\begin{abstract}
%
Neutrinos are fundamental particles that despite being crucial to the formulation of the Standard Model of particles physics, also provide the most convincing evidence that this theory cannot be complete. Here, we make use of the neutral, weakly interacting, and unexplained massive nature of neutrinos to understand what new physics may be hiding at small couplings and light masses. We will be concerned with the many ways to extend the Standard Model to accommodate new light particles, and will review essential aspects of neutrino theory. Our first application is to study neutrino trident production, a rare neutrino scattering process that remains largely unexplored to date. We then advocate this process as a probe of new leptophillc gauge symmetries, together with the well known neutrino-electron scattering. Next, we propose a new model that links neutrinos to new dark states through renormalizable portal couplings. This model generates neutrino masses through radiative corrections and gives rise to a new type of phenomenology at low energies. As an example, we explore the predictions of the model for anomalous experimental results at short-baselines, and how to constrain them using neutrino scattering experiments.

\chapter*{Preface}

These are exciting times in high-energy physics. The Standard Model (SM), our most powerful and well-tested theory of particles and their interactions, triumphs across the experimental landscape and proves to be much more robust than anticipated. Yet, as we will see throughout this thesis, once confronted with some of the simplest questions about the Universe, it provides unsatisfactory answers and, most surprisingly, little theoretical guidance on what may lie beyond. While there is no guarantee that the questions we ask are indeed ``good'' ones, to many, the limitations of the SM attest to the need of a new paradigm in particle physics. Whatever it may be, it makes the series of negative results in particle physics all the more thrilling. Uncertain moments like the one we live are frequent in the history of physics. For many times we saw established theoretical expectations and increasingly fine-tuned models making way for elegant theories like Special Relativity, for new particles such as the neutrino and for new ideas like spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB).

In practice, of course, such grandiose endeavors are reduced to much less noble but no less important efforts. The frequency of negative results and the need to over-constrain our models make the search for new physics a true exercise in patience. Nevertheless, it is in a persistent and curious spirit that this thesis stands. The common theme of the work developed here is that of \emph{hidden neutrino physics}, both in the sense of rare neutrino processes and of hidden sectors beyond the SM. Hidden, dark or secret are all terms associated with new particles that hide not at high energies with $\mathscr{O}(1)$ couplings, but rather at lower scales with couplings to the SM that are much smaller than one. With the exciting theoretical and experimental prospects in neutrino and dark matter physics, we believe that it is all the more timely to think harder about what neutrinos, hidden particles of their own, may teach us about this type of hidden physics. 

We start this thesis by reminding ourselves of the main features and limitations of the SM in this chapter, and delving into unique aspects of neutrino physics in the next. This way, we hope to set the scene and motivate the direction we pursue in the following chapters. Indeed, the processes of neutrino trident production and neutrino-electron scattering we discuss in Chapter 3 are a testimony of the unique properties of neutrinos and the precision achieved in experimental neutrino physics. As an application of these measurements, we will see in Chapter 4 how such signatures probe new gauge interactions much weaker than those in the SM ($g \lesssim 10^{-3}$). The fact that neutrinos are the only neutral fermions in the SM also has interesting consequences for mass generation and naturally connects them to neutral hidden sectors. We explore this connection with a specific model at hand in Chapter 5, scrutinizing its phenomenology at short-baselines in Chapter 6. Finally, in Chapter 7 we look towards the far future and highlight the potential of an entry-level neutrino factory in neutrino physics.
