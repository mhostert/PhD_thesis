	I would like to thank my supervisor Silvia Pascoli for her guidance and for her vision as a supervisor. I am lucky to have been your student and to have had the opportunities you gave me. I am also greatly thankful to Peter Ballett, without whom this thesis would have been but a boring collection of pages. Thank you for your patience and for sharing a bit of your crystal clear thinking with me.

	Carlos Arg\"uelles, Pedro Machado and Renata Zukanovich Funchal, thank you for the inspiration and support. My collaborators Yuber Perez Gonzalez, Zahra Tabrizi and Yu-Dai Tsai, thank you for all the hard work that made this thesis possible.

	Looking further back, I also want to thank D\'ebora Peres Menezes and Marcus Benghi Pinto for introducing me to scientific research so early in my career and understanding the importance of doing so. Nuclear physics and symmetry ideas that at the time seemed so foreign to me have reappered in my own research several times.

	To my family, thank you for supporting my decisions and for being unconditional allies. I would be nothing without the education of my mother and the wisdom of my father. B\^e, you are simply the \emph{best}.

	Madeline, your support and sense of humour have been truly out of this world. Thank you for being such a great partner and for filling life with laughter.

\chapter*{Preface}

These are exciting times in high-energy physics. The Standard Model (SM), our most powerful and well-tested theory of particles and their interactions, triumphs across the experimental landscape and proves to be much more robust than anticipated. Yet, as we will see throughout this thesis, once confronted with some of the simplest questions about the Universe, it provides unsatisfactory answers and, most surprisingly, little theoretical guidance on what may lie beyond. While there is no guarantee that the questions we ask are indeed ``good'' ones, to many, the limitations of the SM attest to the need of a new paradigm in particle physics. Whatever it may be, it makes the series of negative results in particle physics all the more thrilling. Uncertain moments like the one we live are frequent in the history of physics. For many times we saw established theoretical expectations and increasingly fine-tuned models making way for elegant theories like Special Relativity, for new particles such as the neutrino and for new ideas like spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB).

In practice, of course, such grandiose endeavors are reduced to much less noble but no less important efforts. The frequency of negative results and the need to over-constrain our models make the search for new physics a true exercise in patience. Nevertheless, it is in a persistent and curious spirit that this thesis stands. The common theme of the work developed here is that of \emph{hidden neutrino physics}, both in the sense of rare neutrino processes and of hidden sectors beyond the SM. Hidden, dark or secret are all terms associated with new particles that hide not at high energies with $\mathscr{O}(1)$ couplings, but rather at lower scales with couplings to the SM that are much smaller than one. With the exciting theoretical and experimental prospects in neutrino and dark matter physics, we believe that it is all the more timely to think harder about what neutrinos, hidden particles of their own, may teach us about this type of hidden physics. 

We start this thesis by reminding ourselves of the main features and limitations of the SM in this chapter, and delving into unique aspects of neutrino physics in the next. This way, we hope to set the scene and motivate the direction we pursue in the following chapters. Indeed, the processes of neutrino trident production and neutrino-electron scattering we discuss in Chapter 3 are a testimony of the unique properties of neutrinos and the precision achieved in experimental neutrino physics. As an application of these measurements, we will see in Chapter 4 how such signatures probe new gauge interactions much weaker than those in the SM ($g \lesssim 10^{-3}$). The fact that neutrinos are the only neutral fermions in the SM also has interesting consequences for mass generation and naturally connects them to neutral hidden sectors. We explore this connection with a specific model at hand in Chapter 5, scrutinizing its phenomenology at short-baselines in Chapter 6. Finally, in Chapter 7 we look towards the far future and highlight the potential of an entry-level neutrino factory in neutrino physics.
