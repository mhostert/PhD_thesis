\begin{abstract}
%
Neutrino masses and mixing stand as the most compelling evidence that the established theory of particle physics, the Standard Model, cannot be complete. This thesis explores the neutral, weakly interacting, and unexplained massive nature of neutrinos to search for new particles that may be light, but very weakly coupled to ordinary matter. Our first topic of interest is neutrino trident production, a rare neutrino scattering process that remains largely unexplored and unmeasured to date. After revisiting its calculation, we advocate this process as a probe of leptophilic anomaly-free gauge symmetries, together with the well known process of neutrino-electron scattering. Next, we propose a dark neutrino model, where MeV scale heavy neutrinos display new hidden gauge interactions. This model generates neutrino masses via radiative corrections and displays a new type of phenomenology at low energies. We discuss the unique interplay of the three neutral portals to dark sectors, and the neutrino connections to dark matter in the model. Finally, we explore the predictions of phenomenological realizations of dark neutrinos to explain the anomalous experimental results at MiniBooNE, and devise a novel way to constrain them using neutrino-electron scattering measurements.

\chapter*{Preface}

These are exciting times in high-energy physics. The Standard Model (SM), our most powerful and well-tested theory of particles and their interactions, triumphs across the experimental landscape and proves to be much more robust than anticipated. Yet, once confronted with some of the simplest questions about the Universe, it provides unsatisfactory answers and, to our great frustration, little theoretical guidance on what may lie beyond. While there is no guarantee that some of the theoretical questions we ask are indeed ``good'' ones, we may rely on two indirect experimental evidences to claim the SM is incomplete: neutrino masses and the existence of dark matter in our Universe. These two unexplained observations suggest the existence of new neutral particles, calling not only for extended particle content but also for novel symmetries. It makes the series of negative results in particle physics all the more thrilling. Uncertain moments like the one we live are frequent in the history of physics. For many times we saw established theoretical expectations and increasingly fine-tuned models making way for elegant theories like Special Relativity, new particles such as the neutrino and for new ideas like spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB).

In practice, of course, such grandiose endeavors are reduced to much less noble but no less important efforts. The frequency of negative results and the need to over-constrain our models make the search for new physics a true exercise in patience. Nevertheless, it is in a persistent and curious spirit that this thesis stands. In fact, the great efforts in neutrino physics to measure 

The common theme of the work developed here is that of \emph{hidden neutrino physics}, both in the sense of rare neutrino processes and of hidden sectors beyond the SM. Hidden, dark or secret are all terms associated with new particles that hide not at high energies with $\mathscr{O}(1)$ couplings, but rather at lower scales with couplings to the SM that are much smaller than one. With the exciting theoretical and experimental prospects in neutrino and dark matter physics, we believe that it is all the more timely to think harder about what neutrinos, hidden particles of their own, may teach us about this type of hidden physics. 

We start this thesis with by reminding ourselves of the main features and limitations of the SM, and by delving into unique aspects of neutrino physics. Chapters 1 and 2 will set the scene and motivate the direction we pursue in the original work of the chapters that follow. Indeed, the process of neutrino trident production we discuss in Chapter 3 is a testimony of the unique properties of neutrinos and the precision achieved in current and future generation neutrino experiments. As an application of these measurements, we will see in Chapter 4 how such signatures probe new gauge interactions much weaker than those in the SM ($g \lesssim 10^{-3}$). The fact that neutrinos are the only neutral fermions in the SM also has interesting consequences for mass generation and naturally connects them to neutral hidden sectors. We explore this connection with a specific model at hand in Chapter 5, where we build a new model for neutrino masses that can be tested below the Electroweak scale. This model also has plenty of novel phenomenology that can be explored at the intensity frontier, and we scrutinize some of its consequences for short-baseline anomalies in Chapter 6.
