\begin{acknowledgements*}

	I would like to thank my supervisor Silvia Pascoli for her guidance and for her vision as a supervisor. I am also grateful to have had the chance to learn from and work with Peter Ballett. To both, thank you for your patience and admirable dedication.

	My collaborators Carlos Arg\"uelles, Yuber Perez Gonzalez, Zahra Tabrizi and Yu-Dai Tsai. I am also grateful for the inspiration from Pedro Machado and Renata Zukanovich Funchal.

	
	Looking back, I also want to thank Prof. D\'ebora Peres Menezes and Prof. Marcus Benghi Pinto for introducing me to scientific research so early in my career and understanding the importance of doing so.
