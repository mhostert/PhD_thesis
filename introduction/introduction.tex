These are exciting times in high-energy physics. The Standard Model (SM), our most powerful and well-tested theory of particles and their interactions, triumphs across the experimental landscape and proves to be much more robust than ever anticipated. Yet, as we will see throughout this thesis, once confronted with some of the most fundamental questions about the Universe, it provides very few answers and, most surprisingly, little theoretical guidance on what may lie beyond. This apathy of nature with respect to theoretical expectations makes the prospect of new discoveries our hope for a new paradigm shift in fundamental physics. In practice, of course, such grandiose endeavors are reduced to much less noble but just as important efforts; the search for new physics is a true exercise in patience and exploration. 

It is in this climate that this thesis stands, putting forward one specific direction: \emph{neutrinos} as major probes and messengers of hidden sectors beyond the SM. We begin this thesis with a reminder of the successes and failures of the SM, and dedicate the next chapter to some standard aspects of neutrino physics. All subsequent work builds on motivations put forward in these two introductory chapter, and is an original product of the peculiar nature of neutrinos.


\section{The Standard Model}

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is a Yang-Mills theory~\cite{Yang:1954ek} of strong, weak and electromagnetic (EM) particle interactions based on a $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$ local gauge symmetry. It is remarkable that such a rich theoretical framework is so similar in nature to the ideas behingd Maxwell equations, both relying purely on the principle of gauge invariance. The official conception of the SM is widely associated with the appearance of a model restricted to leptons based on a spontaneously broken $SU(2) \times U(1)$ local gauge symmetry first developed by Sheldon L. Glashow~\cite{Glashow:1961tr}, Steven Weinberg~\cite{Weinberg:1967tq} and Abdus Salam~\cite{Salam:1968rm}. Aside from the strong force and some additional particle content, this model already reflects most of what we know about the weak and EM interactions nowadays. In fact, the spontaneous breaking of the symmetry via the Higgs mechanism~\cite{Higgs:1964ia,Higgs:1964pj} predicted the existence of a charged massive vector boson $W^\pm$, a neutral massive vector boson $Z$ and of the massless generator of the unbroken $U(1)_{\rm EM}$ group, the photon $\gamma$. Beyond the unification of the weak and EM forces, it provided a mechanism for mass generation via the higgs boson $H$. This last prediction has received strong experimental validation through the discovery of the a neutral scalar boson at the LHC in 2012~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012xdj,Aad:2012tfa}, the last SM particle to be experimentally observed.

The strong force had a much richer and more turbulent history. The quark model, developed by Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig~\cite{Zweig:1981pd,GellMann:1964nj} in 1964, had great success in explaining the growing number of hadronic resonances found by experiments. It was not until asymptotic freedom was discovered in non-Abelian gauge theories~\cite{Gross:1973id,Politzer:1973fx}, however,  that quantum chromodynamics (QCD) was really born. QCD is a  $SU(3)_{\rm C}$ local gauge theory describing the interaction of quarks and gluons, and is vastly different from any other theory we will encounter in this thesis. Its uniqueness is best exemplified through color confinement, the property that colored particles must always be present in bound colorless state, called hadrons. For QCD, confinement is guaranteed below the scale $\Lambda_{\rm QCD} \approx 250$ MeV, below which any strong process below $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$ is non-perturbative.The presence of new degrees of freedom other than quarks and gluons at low energies, namely the hadrons, is a clear evidence of a phase transition. This is to be contrasted with asymptotic freedom, where the strong interactions between quarks and gluons become asymptotically weaker at higher energies.

The covariant derivative in the SM is given by
%
\begin{equation}
 D_\mu = \partial_\mu + ig \,W_\mu^a\tau_a + i\frac{Y}{2} g^\prime \,B_\mu + i\frac{g_s}{2} \,G_\mu^b\lambda_b,
\end{equation}
%
The covariant derivative allows us to \emph{i)} write down kinetic terms for all SM fermions, \emph{ii)} specify all gauge interactions for fermion and bosons. Take a purely electromagnetically interacting field $\psi$, for instance. A gauge transformation yields
\[\psi \to e^{-i\Lambda} \psi, \quad A_\mu \to A_\mu - \frac{1}{e}\partial_\mu \Lambda \,\,\implies\,\, D_\mu \psi \to e^{-i\Lambda}D_\mu\psi \,\,\implies \,\, \overline{\psi} i\slashed{D}\psi \to \overline{\psi} i \slashed{D} \psi, \]
explicitly showing the fermion kinetic term is invariant. Similar considerations apply for any gauge transformation within the SM. The invariant term in the relation above is the fermion kinetic term and it does not only allow for fermions to propagate, it also generates all fermion-gauge interactions in the SM. Expanding it we have
\begin{equation}
 \overline{\psi}\gamma^\mu\left[ i\partial_\mu  - g \,W_\mu^a\tau_a  - \frac{Y}{2} g^\prime \,B_\mu - \frac{g_s}{2} \,G_\mu^b\lambda_b \right]\psi,
\end{equation}


Self interactions ? gluons change colour.  If we measure higgs self interactions, this will be a first. But how about longitudinal W and Z?



\subsection{Spontaneous symmetry breaking}


After EWSB, the background higgs field always has a non-zero expectation value. In any isolated process, no matter how large the energies and momentum transfers involved, the relevant degrees of freedom are the ones in the broken phase (\ie $h$). 

Higgs questions? elementary or composite? Natural? Portal to dark sector? All fermions get a mss from it? Is it alone? Single resonance?


\section{Beyond the Standard Model}

With such an elegant and successful theory, why would we need to go beyond? Experiment. The single most important evidence for physics beyond the standard model comes from experimental evidence that neutrinos have mass. We will come back to this point in great detail in Chapter 2, but...




As promised, here are the most fundamental questions about our Universe, and why the SM is an unsatisfactory theory to answer them.

\paragraph{How do particle acquire mass?} We have seen how quarks and charged-leptons may acquire mass through Yukawa interactions with the higgs boson. However, \emph{neutrino} masses are 


\subsection{Hitting a desert}

\subsection{Portals to hidden sectors}

Given the hints that dark sectors beyond the SM may exist, we would like to investigate all the possible ways the particles in this sector may interact with the SM. One way to tackle this question is using effective field theories, where one studies all operators which are allowed by the content and symmetries of the SM. The idea is to construct a series of $d>4$ operators in $1/\Lambda^{d-4}$, where $\Lambda$ is the scale of the new physics. This approach thrives on its generality, but can become complicated very quickly with growing $d$. Most importantly, the scale $\Lambda$ is assumed to be large, so that all new degrees of freedom have been integrated out of the theory. This is suitable for extentions involving particles which are very heavy, but the series is no longer well defined for new physics that is light and kinematically accessible at our experiments. In this case, the dynamics and kinematics of the new particles have to be specified, forcing us to write down the field content and symmetry group of the new physics. This is how we will proceed in this thesis.

We would like our SM extensions to follow specific \emph{guiding principles} and \emph{organise} them in a meaninful way. One way to do so is to study all the low dimension \emph{neutral} operators that the SM has to offer. In contrast to effective field theories, we want \emph{renormalisable} operators with $d<4$ which are also gauge invariant. As it turns only a few such operators exist, which we usually refer to as portals. We dedicate the following sections to understanding these.

\paragraph{Neutrino portal} 

Argubly the most motivated portal, this $d=5/2$ operator can be written as
\begin{equation}
 \left( \overline{L} \cdot H\right), \quad \mathrm{and}\quad \left( \overline{L} \cdot \tilde{H}\right).
\end{equation}
Any fermion field which couples to this operator acquires couplings to charged leptons and neutrinos in the standard model. The latter is particularly important, since it leads to mixing between the new species and the SM neutrinos. The new particle is then commonly called a \emph{sterile neutrino} or a heavy neutral lepton.

\paragraph{Vector portal}

Any new vector particle from an abelian gauge may couple to the $d=2$ field strength of the SM hypercharge
\begin{equation}
B_{\mu\nu}.
\end{equation}
The resulting term, $B_{\mu\nu} X^{\mu\nu}$, is usually referred to as the kinetic mixing operator.

\paragraph{Higgs portal}

New scalar particles can mix with the SM higgs boson via 
\begin{equation}
 H^\dagger H.
\end{equation}
In this case there are more possibilities depending on the nature of the new scalar field. Analogously to the SM, one could write  $H^\dagger H \, S^\dagger S$ for a charged, or $H^\dagger H\, S $ for a siglet complex scalar. The latter term is the only super-renormalisable operator connecting the SM fields to new physics which is allowed.  The phenomenology can be quite different depending on the charges of the new scalar, but in general The second operator has been discussed in detail in Ref.~\cite{Fradette:2018hhl} and arises naturally in relaxion models ...).

A very simple BSM model with such portal arises in scalar singlet $S$ extensions, where one generates the term $H^\dagger H \, S^\dagger S$~\cite{Silveira:1985rk}. Remarkably, this extension can also have consequences to the "little hierarchy" problem, as the new scalar also contributes to the Higgs self-energy~\cite{Craig:2013xia}.


\paragraph{Fermionic currents}

A whole set of neutral operators in the SM come from the fermionic currents
\begin{equation}
 J^\mu \equiv \overline{\psi} \gamma^\mu \psi,
\end{equation}
where $\psi \in \{Q_L, L, u_R, d_R, \ell_R\}$. This provides SM currents which can be associated with new conserved quantities, \eg we can choose to gauge. with a new vector. The first condition is that it be locally conserved $\partial_\mu J^\mu = 0$. 

\paragraph{Pseudo-scalar} Axions~\cite{Weinberg:1977ma}.

\subsection{Others}

Other possibilities for portals which we will not discuss in this thesis include the pseudoscalar portal, also known as the axion. This is also a very compelling avenue, as we generally expect light pseudo-Nambu-Goldstones to appear from the breaking of high scale symmetry groups. (see ...). Finally, see the dual...

Another interesting expectation for light new physics is that the new particles be electromagnetically neutral. This purely empirical constraint may not always hold, a classical example being millicharged particles which have escaped detection purely due to their small charges. The abelian nature of QED and of many of our SM extensions is actually unique in the sense that charge may not be quantized (see \eg ...).
